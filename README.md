# user-embed-former

A Transformer-based approach for embedding user behavior sequences and performing unsupervised user segmentation.

## Project Overview

This project explores how to represent user behavior logs as embeddings using a Transformer encoder, and then cluster these embeddings to discover user segments. It's especially suitable for applications like game analytics, e-commerce behavior modeling, or log-based user profiling.
